# PLW-Crowd-Stimuli
Heading detection experiment through a crowd of PLW walkers

 Experiment to measure heading performance in crowds of normal Point Light Walkerss that
 articulate their limbs or maintain a static posture while translating
 through space. Ground plane points are also presented and their number is varied.
 
 Designed for Mac running Matlab 2014b with Psychtoolbox (version 3.0.14) toolbox. 
 
 Walker file should be placed in the same folder as the program
 
 A new subfolder named "data" will also need to be created in the program folder to store data
